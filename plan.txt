organ to android
	usb host, works fine

android to dallben 
	TouchDAW with ipMIDI to multimidicast, working.

	TouchOSC, Control, etc can do OSC for stop console. TouchOSC doesn't
	have custom layouts for android yet, so Control is it. bonus: easy to
	do programmatic layouts with Control

	need midi relay solution (probably write my own with nmj, or read midi
	and send OSC. Maybe Control can be hacked to do it)

aeolus headless
	-t works, though you can't control midi settings with text ui they
	won't need changing often and it remembers them. Adding midi commands
	to the textui wouldn't be too hard.

	midi or osc stop control ? supposedly it has midi support, so just
	figure out a way to connect an osc console on android to midi (little
	proxy program?)
		Maybe Control can be adapted with nmj to send over ipMIDI
		instead of only RTPMIDI. Otherwise a little relay program to
		translate OSC to MIDI.

	I'm using hw:0,3 which is the HDMI output. Works as long as the TV is
	on, but hogs the device. I'll probably just figure out which device is
	the audio jack on the front and run a wire to the receiver. Better than
	having the TV on and fighting with myth.

	Idea: run aeolus in a detachable X thing so you can hop in and tweak
	things from time to time. nx or vnc probably.

future work
	if ipMIDI is found lacking, implement RTPMIDI (probably a matter of
	adapting the sfront network code http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/rtpmidi/)

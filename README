The stop jamb is the panel that holds stop knobs.

Hooking up MIDI keyboards to Aeolus is straightforward: connect them to your PC
over a joystick port or with a USB MIDI adapter. But changing stops at the
organ console is a more difficult proposition. This suite of tools will enable
your Android tablet/iPad to become a stop jamb for controlling Aeolus.

. Put Aeolus.js on your webserver (or use http://hans.fugal.net/jamb/Aeolus.js)
. Start aeolus (perhaps with -t in a screen session for a headless setup)
. Start aeolus-osc.py (perhaps providing non-default options)
. Install Control on your tablet http://charlie-roberts.com/Control/
. Add an Interface to Control using that URL
. Set the Control OSC destination to your Aeolus server and port (default 8080)
. Don't forget to connect your MIDI keyboard to Aeolus
. Pull stops and perform!
